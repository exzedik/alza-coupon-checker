# alza-coupon-checker
Alza.cz coupon generator and checker. Made to help me understand threading and reverse engineer APIs.


Expect none to very little chance of actually getting a hit. The chances are very low, this tool is practically useless. I didn't find any pattern in their code generation system and the coupons seem randomly generated (which would make sense). I also didn't experience any ratelimits but that could change. Otherwise the tool should work, I've had pretty good results of around 300CPM/thread, but this may vary depending on your PC/network. Best of luck.
